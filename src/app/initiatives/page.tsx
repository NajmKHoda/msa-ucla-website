            <p>
                The UCLA MSA believes that faith is more than just beliefâ€”it&apos;s action.
                Our initiatives bring together students to serve, uplift, and strengthen our Muslim community while embodying the values of Islam.
                Whether through advocacy, service, education, or social engagement, each of our projects and committees is dedicated to making a tangible impact on campus and beyond.

                <p>
                    Committees operate directly under the MSA, giving members a way to get involved
                    in critical functions such as planning end-of-year banquets and facilitating the Ramadan experience.

                <p>
                    Projects are independent organizations associated with the MSA, each with its own leadership and goals.
                    Our projects focus on community service, outreach, and education, allowing students to engage with the broader community.
